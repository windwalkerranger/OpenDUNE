# Custom Atreides Campaign

Overall premise:
Atreides have been betrayed by the Emperor. With a small number of survivors, harvesters and an MCV ready to break down at the first storm, young Orchun Atreides seeks shelter at the depths of the desert.

There is talk of a prophecy, that the young Orchun is the chosen one, but most consider it superstition. Orchun has to prove, over the course of this campaign, that he is the chosen one, not only by overcoming impossible odds, but also doing so with miraculous victories.

In this campaign, some missions will have a scoring system that yield a score between 0 and 100, and the average score upon campaign completion will determine the fate of the house Atreides. below 50 you will have a personal victory but the fremen and the houses will not unite and there will be war throughout the galaxy. 50 to 90 is considered a good ending, leading to a period o4f relative piece where the emperor is dethroned. But perfection with 90+ will lead to everyone believing the young Orchun is the prophesized leader, and there will be a very long piece - the golden path.

## Mission 1 : The Rock Bottom

You have 5 harvesters. 1 is full. 2 are half full. 2 are empty. Empty ones are new and are at full health
The others are used, and have some damage.
You have a couple trikes and a few infantry units, led by a specialized trooper unit.
You start at top right of the map and try to reach bottom left.
You must bring it at least 2 harvesters to the bottom left area.

No time limit, but the enemy keeps getting reinforcements.
Your score is based on the amount of solaris you bring with your harvesters.
100 = all harvesters arrive full (7000 credits). 0= no credits.


## Mission 2 : Forced Landing

Before you could reach the intended destination reported to you by your scouts as safe and rich, your harvesters began to falter, and you had to set camp on the first rock formation you could find. Your men qucikly repurposed all your harvesters but one into a rag-tag base. Within days you make contact with a nearby smuggler base, who are ready and willing to purchase your spice. The repurpose one of their refineries for your harvester, and you get to work.

While the Harkonnen Baron is busy dealing with the aftermath of their attack, they are paying mercenaries to scout and eliminate any Atreides survivors in the desert.

You must collect 10.000 solaris. 
Each five minutes will send enemy reinforcements, and each reinforcement will be stronger than the last.
Your score will be determined by a starting amount, reduced by each unit you lose (calculated by the base production cost of the unit).

start with 100 score.
acceptable losses = 1.000 solaris
each 100 solari worth of unit lost beyond this threshold is -1 points
each 1000 solari worth of enemy units destroyed is +1 points.

## Mission 3 : Decoy

Not only your location was found, but some smuggler talked and your identity as the sole surviving Atreides noble has reached Harkonnen ears. Eager to earn his uncle's approval, Rabban quickly rushed in with his fastest troops to destroy you once and for all.

Your grand payment to smugglers satisfied them well enough to carry your people into a safe location, an abandoned ecological experimentation and survey station deep in the desert and underground. You set them on their way and stay back with some of your most trusted liutenants to act as a target/decoy.

You need to survive at least 15 minutes in this scenario.
It will be nonstop enemy attacks, coming from two different bases along with new enemy reinforcements every 2 minutes.

Your score will be the total amount of units you have destroyed AFTER 15 minutes(calculated by their cost), and each building you destroy from the existing enemy bases will boost the score substantially.

each 1000 solari worth of enemy units destroyed is +1 points, up to a maximum of 75
if you destroy all enemy buildings, you get +25 points.
(perfect ending goes beyond doing what the mission objectives tell you, and destroying the enemy bases)

## Mission 4 : Rebellion

You jump at a thopter and dive into a storm to survive that deathtrap, and the storm lands you very close to an harkonnen concentration camp. Knowing you can't survive in the desert, you instead infiltrate the base and disguise yourself as a worker.
Within weeks you have your own information network, and you are ready to start a rebellion to capture the base.

This map consists of several harkonnen bases, one of which you switch to your side. Your network of captives also grab whatever vehicles they can, the most important of which are a trio of damaged tanks.

The objective is to destroy all Harkonnen bases.
New units can only be procured by destroying enemy buildings.
Score starts at 0
+1 point for every 100 solari worth of surviving units at game end, max 100.

## Mission 5 : Reunion

Most of the survivors of the concentration camp were Fremen, who go their own way back to their sietches. You and some others take a long journey to the station your people were sent to. When you arrive you find it under Harkonnen siege, led by Feyd Rautha. You muster your meager forces to capture a resupply base of your enemies. Now you must quickly produce and destroy the enemies before they can destroy your people

In this map, the Harkonnen forces are sieging a relatively well defended neutral base representing your house. This base can only produce passive defences and infantry.

Score starts at 100
For every non-turret and non-wall structure lost at initial base, you lose 10 points.

## Mission 6 : Consolidation

Defeating Feyd meant that Harkonnen are aware young Orchun has survived. The emperor has heard this and has sent back specialist hunter Sardokar units into deep desert. For now, he operates without a base on the planet, sending reinforcements from the orbit, while harkonnen keep up the open confrontation. To strike back at Arrakeen, you must first capture a very important port city, Tarnapour, which is the main supply line for the Sardokar.

This is a classical 1v1 map against Harkonnen, but with Sardokar reinforcements of ever-increasing strength.
The score will be calculated based on enemies destroyed, units lost, and time spent

## Mission 7 : Unknown Assailants

Many Smuggler and Mercenary groups suddenly change behaviour and unite under a single flag. They cut communications with you and suddenly attack one of your forward bases, which was being built under your supervision. You immediately call for reinforcements, but their numbers seem overwhelming. Will you be able to survive?

This is a fight against two smuggler bases and a merc base. Your new base can only produce infantry and light vehicles, while the smugglers can bring in medium tanks and mercs have misile launchers. Your only chance is your fremen reinforcements, and your thopters.
The score will be calculated based on enemies destroyed, units lost, and time spent



## Mission 8 : Unexpected Interference

Minor houses learn of Emperor's interventions on Atreides-Harkonnen war, and decide to rebel. They consolidate Smugglers and Mercenaries, and send their own specialist units as well, to attack Harkonnen and Sardokar alike. These were the assailants in the previous level, and now call themselves Ordos.

In this map, it's a 1v1v1. Atreides vs Ordos vs Harkonnen, who can't receive Sardokar reinforcements for now.
Harkonnen now use Death Hand misiles. Ordos now have deviators. You deploy your sonic tanks.
Upon losing half of their buildings, Harkonnen receive a huge wave of reinforcements that land on defensive positions. Upon losing half of their structures, Ordos receive a huge wave of reinforcements that land around your own base as a counter-attack.
The score will be calculated based on enemies destroyed, units lost, and time spent.

## Mission 9 : Once and For All

The emperor has landed on the planet. He promised the Arrkis to the Ordos if we are defeated. He will let the Baron live if we are defeated. Now its him and his crooks agains us and our fremen allies.
This is the epic 1v3. Endless enemy reinforcements, more triggered reinforcements as they lose half their buildings, and as each of the factions are eliminated, the remaining ones grow stronger.
This map will always yield a score of 100 if you succeed.
